      <h1>About</h1>
      <section>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Catherine, and I recently graduated from <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="blank">The Flatiron School</a> as a Ruby on Rails and Javascript devloper. I come to the programming world from a career as a professional opera singer, and I am constantly amazed at the parallels between the two.</p>
        <p>In fact, it was my background in music that led me to my first experience with coding. While working at a music school with an archaic website that no one knew how to update, I took it upon myself to learn HTML, and updated it myself. I enjoyed it so much that I started playing around with reformatting the site as well.</p>
        <p>Since then, my love for creating things through code has only deepened. The more I learn, the more infatuated I become!</p>
