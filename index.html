      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m Catherine and I’m a Ruby newbie. I came to The Flatiron School after leaving a career as a professional opera singer, and I am constantly amazed at the parallels between these two careers. In fact, it was my background in music that led me to my first experience with coding. While working at a music school with an archaic website that no one knew how to update, I took it upon myself to learn HTML, and updated it myself. I enjoyed it so much that I started playing around with reformatting the site as well. Since then, my love for creating things through code has only deepened. The more I learn, the more infatuated I become!</p>
